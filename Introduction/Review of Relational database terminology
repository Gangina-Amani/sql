Database: SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field. In a relational database, this data is organized into Tables.
Table:  Table is a group of Records, each representing the same sort of data.
Record: Records are also known as a row in a Table. Each row in a table is distinct, but all share a common set of Fields. All rows have the same kind of data, but refer to unique Records.
Field: Fields are also known as columns in a Table; (in Excel, the field names are what you would use for column headings)
Parse: to separate out the data into appropriate columns or fields; in Excel, the function Data / Text to Columns parses the file into Records (by rows) and Fields (by columns)
Delimiter: The delimiter is a character in SQL which is used to separate the data items in a database. It identifies the beginning and end of the character string.
Data entry: Data entry includes creating, updating, and deleting records. In Excel, this can be done in the spreadsheet directly or using GUI interfaces
Sort: Sorting is about arranging the data or information in a specific order.
Sort keys (primary, secondary, tertiary sort keys): the fields (first, second, third ...) fields used to determine the sort order
Selection: selecting a subset of the records. In Excel, filters can be used to select sets of records
Selection criteria: the criteria for using a Filter or for use with the Excel database functions
Filter: Complies with a data selection by "hiding" data that do not meet the stated criteria
Query: determining the data selection and/or sort and/or any calculations to be performed on the data
Aggregate functions in a query: as seen in the Excel database functions
