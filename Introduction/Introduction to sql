Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to create and modify the structure of objects in a database using predefined commands and a specific syntax. 
These database objects include tables, sequences, locations, aliases, schemas and indexes.
All DDL commands are auto-committed. That means it saves all the changes permanently in the database.
